Ledger is a web program i use to keep track of bills there amount and whether theyre paid.

on Finances.html i can enter a bill name and the amount of that bill. i can also enter a week number (1-4) and the allotted amount for gas and the program will save those two things to local storage.

On index.html those entered gas and bill objects are loaded from local storage and displayed on page where i can check off the bill if paid or enter an amount that is then subtracted from alloted gas amount. Those updates are then saved to local storage.
