Ledger is a web program styled for mobile devices only that i use to keep track of bills, their amount and if they're paid.

On Finances.html i can enter a bill name and the amount of that bill. i can also enter a week number (1-4) and the allotted amount for gas and the program will save those two things to local storage.

I can also add the amount owed on a mastercard and add and to subtract from that amount, saving it on local storage.

On index.html those entered gas and bill objects are loaded from local storage and displayed on page where i can check off the bill if paid or enter an amount that is then subtracted from alloted gas amount. Those updates are then saved to local storage.

Ledger can be viewed by visiting: https://braedonklock.github.io/Ledger/
